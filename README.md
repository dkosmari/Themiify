# Themiify
Themiify is a homebrew application that allows for on the fly installation of Wii U Menu themes via the [Themezer](https://themezer.net/) API or via `.utheme` files placed on an SD Card.
Once a theme is installed, [StyleMiiU](https://github.com/Themiify-hb/StyleMiiU-Plugin) will read the theme and show it the next time the Wii U Menu is loaded.

## Requirements
***Themiify will only work if you have the StyleMiiU aroma plugin installed and if your Wii U Menu's files on your Wii U's NAND are unmodified!***

Themiify will perform checks for these conditions at boot and let you know if they are not met.

## Usage
### Network Tab
You can download themes uploaded to Themezer from this tab. To search for more specific themes you can use different filters, the search bar or QR codes.

### Local Themes Tab
You can install `.utheme` files placed in `sd:/wiiu/themes` from this tab. You can also manage your installed themes here with the ability to either delete them or
set them as your current StyleMiiU theme on the fly.

### Settings Tab
If you are a theme creator, a quick way to dump your menu files from your NAND would be here. Simply select `Dump Wii U Menu Files` and follow the instructions
to dump!
